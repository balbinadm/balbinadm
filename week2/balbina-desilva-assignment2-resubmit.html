            <p>
            The purpose of this website will be to showcase my portfolio in in a simple yet striking way. The website will allow me to apply for design internships and to explain my integrated design practice.

        <section id="tone">
            <h2>What tone do you want for this site's written content?</h2>
            <p>
         The content is intended to be presentable and formal. In terms of tone, I would like it to be professional yet authentic to my own voice as a designer.

        <section id="primary">
            <h2>What will be the primary content of your site? </h2>
            <p>
            The primary content of my site will be my work. I will ideally have a home page with a menu that will separate different categories of my work. I would like to include three main sections: graphic design, product design, and fine arts.
            </p>

        <section id="secondary">
            <h2>What will the secondary content?</h2>
            <p>
            The secondary content of my site will invole an about me section, and a contact section.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="navigation">
            <h2>How will users navigate through your site?</h2>
            <p>
         I want my site navigation to be quite simple. I want the user to always be able to the homepage from any page, and that the pages menu is clear. I want to create a drop down menu or a bar menu that could allow the user to switch between pages and design sections.
