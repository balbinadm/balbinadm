	<h1> Project 1 Site Enhancement Proposal</h1>
	<h1 class="period">.</h1>
	
	<h2>I want to continue refining my portfolio site for several reasons. With the skills I have learned so far, I feel like I can focus more on adding new features and more refined styling. Additionally my goal is to build a solid porftolio that truly speaks to who I am and what I do by the end of the course. Three enhancements I would like to make on my site are, media query galleries, to have my images load faster with quality, and to improve the general layout and navigation I really like how Socket Studio's website, <a href="http://www.socketstudios.com/work/powaband/">socketstudios.com</a> is very simple yet they integrate media queries in a way that works. Also, I like their use of the drop down menu, because it is subtle but useful. This has also made me consider adding a drop down menu to improve navigation for the user. </h2>
